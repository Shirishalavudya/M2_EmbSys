# Introduction:

Nowadays, we have remote controls for our television sets and other electronic systems, which have made our lives real easy. Have you ever wondered about home automation which would give the facility of controlling tube lights, fans and other electrical appliances at home using a remote control? Off-course, Yes! But, are the available options cost effective? If the answer is No, we have found a solution to it. We have come up with a new system called Arduino based home automation using Bluetooth. This system is super-cost effective and can give the user, the ability to control any electronic device without even spending for a remote control. This project helps the user to control all the electronic devices using his/her smartphone. Time is a very valuable thing. Everybody wants to save time as much as they can. New technologies are being introduced to save our time. To save peopleâ€™s time we are introducing Home Automation system using Bluetooth . With the help of this system you can control your home appliances from your mobile phone. You can turn on/off your home appliances within the range of Bluetooth.

# Challenges Faced and How Was it Overcome:

1)Struggled with implementaion of whole code.

2)strggled with schematic connections and generating hex file.

# Objectives:

The main objective of home automation system is to help handicapped and aged people that will enable them to control home appliances and alert them in critical situations.

# 4 W'S and 1H

# Who
Now a days it is using in all homes and mainly in smart homes.

# What
The purpose of home automation system is to streamline how your home functions.

# When
This is used to control the home functions like ON/OFF activities ,when we are outside and it mostly usefull to handicapped and aged people.

# Where
In this system we integrate mobile devices into home automation system.

# How
The system consists of mainly three components is a BLUETOOTH module, Arduino microcontroller and relay circuits.WIFI is used as the communication channel between phone and the Arduino microcontroller.

# SWOT Analysis

## Strength

1)It is very economic and easy to handle by the user.

2)It is helpfull to disabled people.

3)It is very easy to install in office,houses ets.

## weakness

1)Arduino is the heart of the circuit ,if controller is damaged the whole system will be interrupted.
